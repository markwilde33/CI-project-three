## Instructions From Code Institute



Guidelines for project development:


- The project's logic must be written in Python, HTML and CSS. Use flask, a micro-framework, to structure your project's back-end. 
- Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a pictorial or text-based riddle.
- The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players enter their answer into a text area and submit their answer using a form.
- If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
- If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed below the riddle. The text area is cleared so they can guess again.
- Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time, each in their own browser. Users are identified by a unique username, but note that no authentication features such as a password are required for this project.
- Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all (at least recent) users.
- You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.
- Write a README.md file for your project.
- Use Git & GitHub for version control.
- Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.




## Riddle Information



- Players are requested to register and login to play the game. They can then read the rules or began a game immediately.
- The game consists of 10 animal riddles.
- Players are allowed 3 guesses per riddle.
- Players receive 5 points for each correct answer.
- Players are deducted 1 point for each incorrect answer.
- Players are shown a question and can input their answer in the answer field. Players click the check button to confirm their answer.
- When players give a correct answer they receive a success message and are shown an image of the animal. A link with further information regarding the animal is displayed above the image.
- Players continue with the riddle by clicking on the next question button which displays below the animal image when a correct answer is given.
- When players give an incorrect answer they receive a warning message which also displays how many attempts they have left.
- When a player gives 3 incorrect answers they receive a warning message and are taken to the next riddle.
- On completion of the riddle players receive a message with their final score. They are then directed to back to the start quiz page.
- Players can go to the leaderboard at any time to see if they made the top ten.




## UX

### Design



- Development of the website adhered to a mobile first approach. The site consists of six pages. It uses a simplistic design with minimal content, allowing users to focus on the riddle game. 
  
- Some psychedelic animal images from the artist [Alex Grey](https://m.alexgrey.com/) were used to give the site some personality. Background images were used on some pages to add depth. An image on the start quiz page is hidden on smaller screens to improve the aesthetic.

- All pages share the same navbar and footer, though each page has a clear purpose and some unique functionality.
  
- The Bootstrap framework underpins the project and was implemented as per convention.

- The websites animal art was chosen as it is thought provoking and a little mysterious, this theme ties in well with the sites main purpose, it being an animal riddle quiz. 
 
- A picture of each animal displays on each correct answer, to keep users engaged.
  
- links to external sites with additional information were included, for those users who like to have easy access to further information.




### User Stories



Several user stories were considered before development began:



1. "As an animal lover I want to play a simple but engaging quiz game to test my knowledge."
 
2. "As an animal lover I want to see pictures of the animals used in the quiz and have an option to read more about each animal."

3. "I want to be able to register a username and sign in. I can then play multiple games and try to beat my previous scores."

4. "I want to be welcomed to the quiz by my unique username and have the rules presented to me before I play the game."

5. "On completion of the quiz I want to see my score and be able to visit a leaderboard. Did I make the top ten? If so, were did I rank?"

6. "I want to play the quiz at the same time as my friends, each on our own browsers, and see who does the best."

7. "I want to be informed how of many guesses I have left when I get a question wrong."

8. "I want to be able to logout at any stage, even if I am in the middle of a game."

      <summary><strong><em>Automated Tests</em></strong></summary>


#### Unit Tests:

A file called riddle_tests.py was created using Python's **unittest** class.

The two tests in this file are displayed below:


*Test 1*

```python
 def test_get_users(self):
        """
        Test to ensure the users list can be retrieved from users.json
        """
        users = app.get_users()
        self.assertEqual(len(users), 1)
```

*code in app.py*

```python
USERS = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(
    os.path.abspath(__file__)) + '/data/users.json')

def get_users():
    # retrieve users from users.json
    users = {}
    with open(USERS) as reader:
        users = json.load(reader)
    return users
```

---

*Test 2*

```python
def test_get_leaders(self):
        """
        Test to ensure the leaders list can be retrieved from leaderboard.json
        """
        leaders = app.get_leaders()
        self.assertEqual(len(leaders), 1)
```

*code in app.py*

```python
LEADERBOARD = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(
    os.path.abspath(__file__)) + '/data/leaderboard.json')

def get_leaders():
     # retrieve leaders from leaderboard.json
    leaders = {}
    with open(LEADERBOARD) as reader:
        leaders = json.load(reader)
    return leaders
```

      <summary><strong><em>Miscellaneous</em></strong></summary>


### Further Testing

- Google chrome developer tools where used at every stage of production to
isolate issues and improve mobile responsiveness.
- The app has been tested on various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
- The app was tested across many screen sizes, from very small to very large.
- Some family members tested the app on their own devices and their recommendations, such as to improve the final quiz score message, were taken on board.
- It is displaying as intended across various devices and in different browsers.


### Issues

- The author is not yet proficient in automated testing, and as such, was unable to adhere to a test driven development approach.
- On the start quiz page, there is an issue where, on some screen sizes, the riddle card displays at a different height than the animal image cards.  
- There is some white space between the flashed messages and the navbar. As some pages use full size background images this pushes the images down a little.
- There was an issue with full screen background images not taking up the full screen space on some smaller mobile screens. As a result, media queries were used to remove background images on some smaller mobile screens.
- On some devices when a user inputs a word a blank space is included after the word. The user may not notice this blank space. However, it will cause their answer to be incorrect. This may lead to confusion. An answer can be uppercase or lowercase but cannot have blank spaces at the beginning or end of the word.

6. Add heroku remote:
    ``` 
    $ heroku git:remote -a flask-riddle
    ``` 
7. Add requirements.txt file (allows heroku to access the projects build pack. This project uses a Pipenv virtual environment, a Pipfile.lock file is automatically generated which contains the build pack. However, this step has been included for reasons of best practice):
    ``` 
    $ sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    $ git add requirements.txt
    $ git commit -m " Added a requirements.txt"
    $ git push heroku master
    ``` 
8.  Add Procfile (instructs heroku how start running the project):
    ``` 
    $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    $ git add Procfile
    $ git commit -m 'Added Procfile'
    $ git push heroku master
    ``` 
9.  Set up dynos:
    ``` 
    $ heroku ps:scale web=1
    ``` 
10. Setup config variables on heroku dashboard:
    - Go to settings and click on reveal config vars
    - Set IP to 0.0.0.0
    - Set PORT to 5000

11. Restart dynos:
    - Navigate into the 'More' menu and select 'Restart all dynos' to update the apps settings.

12. Open app:
